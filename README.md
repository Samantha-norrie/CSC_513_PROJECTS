## Welcome to my repo for my CSC 513: Designing Creativity Support Tools projects! 

I made these three projects over the course of the Fall 2024 semester with the intent of merging quantum computing education (the research area of my Master's) 
with human-computer interaction. Each project received an A+ :) The papers on the projects are in this repo, and the project repos are linked below.

### [Heavy-Hex Box (design fiction project)](https://github.com/Samantha-norrie/THE_HEAVY_HEX_BOX_CSC_513)
The Heavy-Hex box is a visualization tool designed to teach budding quantum software engineers in 2030(+) about low-level quantum programming.

### [StackOverflow_And_I (design physicalization project)](https://github.com/Samantha-norrie/STACK_OVERFLOW_AND_I_CSC_513)
StackOverflow_And_I lets its users explore [StackOverflow's 2024 developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/) by manipulating wooden cards that describe data from the survey and by weaving their own data into them.

### [Bloch Ball (tangible user interface project)](https://github.com/Samantha-norrie/BLOCH_BALL_CSC_513)

The Bloch Ball takes the Bloch sphere, a popular visualization in quantum computing, and turns it into an input device. Users select two states on the Bloch ball and receives the quantum gates needed to travel between them
